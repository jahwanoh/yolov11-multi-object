# YOLOv11 Multi-Object Detection Pipeline

Welcome to the **YOLOv11 Multi-Object** repository! This project provides a hands-on, end-to-end pipeline for object detection and tracking using the latest YOLOv11 framework, with a focus on practical machine learning lifecycle management. The repository is designed for experimentation, annotation, training, and visualization, leveraging modern tools such as Docker, Weights & Biases, and PyTorch.

---

## Features

- **Dockerized Environment**: Reproducible and portable setup for development and training.
- **YOLOv11-based Detection & Tracking**: State-of-the-art object detection and tracking pipeline.
- **Annotation Tools**: Scripts for converting and managing dataset annotations.
- **Training Utilities**: Easy-to-use scripts for training and validation.
- **Visualization**: Integrated with [Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://docs.ultralytics.com/integrations/weights-biases/) for experiment tracking and visualization.
- **PyTorch Support**: Extendable for further research and custom implementations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (recommended)
- Python 3.8+
- [YOLOv11](https://github.com/jahongir7174/YOLOv11-pt) and [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
- [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolov11-multi-object.git
   cd yolov11-multi-object
   ```

2. **Build and run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t yolov11-multi-object .
   docker run -it --gpus all -v $(pwd):/workspace yolov11-multi-object
   ```
   *Or, set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies manually.*

3. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Place your annotated data under `data` following the expected folder structure.

4. **Convert annotations to YOLO format:**
   ```bash
   python bb2yolo.py --dir data
   ```

5. **Generate dataset YAML:**
   ```bash
   python generate_dataset_yml.py --dir data
   ```

---

## Usage

- **Training:**
  - Use the generated `yolo_dataset.yaml` for training with YOLOv11 or Ultralytics tools.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    yolo train data=data/yolo_dataset.yaml model=yolov11.pt wandb=True
    ```

- **Prediction:**
  - Run inference using your trained model and visualize results.

- **Visualization:**
  - Experiment tracking and visualization are integrated with Weights & Biases (wandb).

## Further Study
- Explore custom PyTorch implementations for advanced research and experimentation.
